# Angular-Todo App

## Installation 
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:
Run npm install -g @angular/cli 

To create a new workspace and initial starter app:
Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:
ng new my-app

The Angular CLI includes a server, for you to build and serve your app locally.

Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.

Run the following command: 
cd my-app
ng serve --open

It automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200
